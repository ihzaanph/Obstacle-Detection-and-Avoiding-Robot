# Obstacle-Detection-and-Avoiding-Robot
This project focuses on designing an autonomous, obstacle-avoiding robot using an Arduino Uno, various sensors, and motors to enable real-time navigation in unpredictable environments. The robot detects and avoids obstacles through integrated sensor data and makes quick, autonomous decisions to navigate safely.
